# Deep Learning

In this project i want to Search over some key concepts in deep neural networks and try to play with them to undrestand what really they do. the main goal is to find intution in neural networks functionality and experience some challenges in this area. Sections are concentrate on a specific subject. In every section i will search over google a topic and watch some videos and lectures. Then i will find some good notebooks and python sample codes and implement them here as a practice. Also, i will mention my resources like articels, videos and notebooks. At the end, i wanna wish myself luck and good persevere.
